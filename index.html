    What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the 
    printing and typesetting industry. Lorem 
    Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an 
    unknown printer took a galley of type 
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen 
    book. It has survived not only five 
    centuries, but also the leap into 
    electronic typesetting, remaining 
    essentially unchanged. It was 
    popularised in the 1960s with the 
    release of Letraset sheets containing 
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
    with desktop publishing software like 
    Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
    Lorem Ipsum.
